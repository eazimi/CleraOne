Solutions for exercise 1 and exercise 2

# Assumption
No check is done on the inputs to the programms. It's always assumed that the programms are fed by correct input values that are provided by users. 

# Note
The solution for exercise 2 is inspired by looking at https://github.com/kshk123/hashMap.

# Comments
Comments are avalaible in the codes.

# How to run
mkdir build <br/>
cd build/ <br/>
cmake .. <br/>
make <br/>

to run the solution of exercise 1, use the following command,<br/>
  ./exe1 [an unsigned long long int number] or ./exe1 // the latter form runs the program for default input which is 123456789012345678.<br/><br/>  

to run the solution of exercise 2, simply write down ./exe2 in the command line.<br/><br/>

Cheers!
