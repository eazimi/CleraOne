Solutions for exercise 1 and exercise 2

# Assumption
No check is done on the inputs to the programms. It's always assumed that the programms are fed by correct input values that are provided by users. 

# Note
The solution for exercise 2 is inspired by looking at https://github.com/kshk123/hashMap.

# Comments
Comments are avalaible in the codes.

# How to run
mkdir&nbsp;build <br/>
cd&nbsp;build/ <br/>
cmake&nbsp;.. <br/>
make <br/>

to run the solution of exercise 1, use the following command,<br/>

  ./exe1 [an unsigned long long int number], like ./exe1 1000<br/> 
  or<br/> 
  ./exe1 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; // this form runs the program for the default input value which is 123456789012345678.<br/> 
  
to run the solution of exercise 2, simply write down ./exe2 in the command line.<br/>

Cheers!
